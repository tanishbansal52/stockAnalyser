<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>
  This platform scrapes financial news related to specific stocks from the web and processes it using FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned for financial data hosted on HuggingFace. The platform analyzes market sentiment for each stock, compares its performance against sector ETFs, and presents the data visually. This project employed a full-stack development approach, utilizing Django and Python for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database.
